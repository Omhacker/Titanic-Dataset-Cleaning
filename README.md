🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction - Data Analysis & Visualization

Welcome to the Titanic dataset analysis project! This classic machine learning problem helps uncover insights into what factors influenced passenger survival on the Titanic. Through powerful visualizations and data-driven analysis, this project dives into understanding the hidden patterns within the data.

📌 Project Highlights

- 🔍 Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- 📊 Built compelling **visualizations** to analyze the impact of **gender, class, age, fare, and family size** on survival.
- 💡 Engineered new features like `FamilySize` to extract deeper insights.
- 🌍 Cleaned and processed missing data for consistent analysis.

📈 Key Visualizations

| Visualization             | Insight                                            |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Survival Count            | Overall survival distribution                      |
| Survival by Gender        | Females had higher survival rate                   |
| Survival by Class         | 1st class passengers more likely to survive        |
| Family Size               | Small families survived more often                 |
| Fare vs Survival          | Higher fare = better survival odds                 |
| Correlation Heatmap       | Showed strongest relationships in dataset          |
